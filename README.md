## Study Area
Grand Lake Meadows and Portobello Creek Wetland complex located on the floodplain of the Wolastoq | Saint John River in New Brunswick, Canada (45.884772, -66.243950)

## Methods
For detailed methods see (Rideout 2019; Rideout et al 2020) Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected following the Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring Network (CABIN) wetland protocol and analyzed for DNA-metabarcoding; classifications were then filtered for greater than 99% confidence in correct assignment at the genus level. Trait information for 13 traits and 67 modalities were assigned at the genus level primarily from the USGS Database of Lotic Invertebrate Traits for North America (http://pubs.water.usgs.gov/ds187). Gaps were filled in first from the European freshwaterwater.info database (https://www.freshwaterecology.info), and then from the literature; lastly, any remaining gaps, predominantly amongst zooplankton taxa, were completed at the family level.
